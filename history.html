                The foundations of AI were laid when Warren McCulloch and Walter
                Pitts created the first mathematical model of neural networks in
                1943. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John
                McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, marking the
                official birth of AI as a field.

                This era saw tremendous optimism and breakthroughs. Programs
                could solve algebra problems, prove theorems, and even speak
                English. The first AI lab was established at MIT, and funding
                flourished as researchers believed human-level AI was just
                around the corner.

                Overpromising and underdelivering led to reduced funding and
                interest. The limitations of early AI became apparent -
                computers lacked the processing power and data needed to tackle
                complex problems. This period taught valuable lessons about
                realistic expectations.

                AI experienced a boom with expert systems that could make
                decisions in specialized domains. Companies invested billions in
                these knowledge-based systems. The success of systems like XCON
                showed that AI could deliver real business value.

                Geoffrey Hinton's breakthrough in deep learning transformed AI.
                Neural networks with many layers could learn complex patterns.
                In 2012, AlexNet won the ImageNet competition, proving that deep
                learning could outperform traditional computer vision
                techniques.
